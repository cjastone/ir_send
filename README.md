# ir_send
Demonstrates use of Panasonic TV IR modulation on Arduino using native AVR PWM 

IR modulation is achieved by counting the number of elapsed PWM cycles for precice pulse counting.

This demonstration uses Panasonic commands reverse-engineered by capturing signals using a Mega2560-based logic analyser - more information on this can be found here: https://github.com/gillham/logic_analyzer
